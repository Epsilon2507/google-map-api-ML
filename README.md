Google Maps Pathfinding Project
This project demonstrates how to use the Google Maps API to find the best path between an origin and a destination, with optional waypoints. It includes a Python script that can be run in Google Colab, which uses the Google Maps API to retrieve the most efficient route based on real-time data.

Features
Finds the best path between two locations
Optimizes waypoints for efficiency
Retrieves distance and duration information
Supports multiple modes of transportation (driving, walking, bicycling, etc.)
Requirements
Google Colab or a local Python environment
Python 3.x
A Google Maps API Key
Installation
Clone this repository or copy the provided Python code into your Google Colab or local Python environment.

Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install googlemaps
Obtain a Google Maps API Key:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project (if necessary).
Enable the Google Maps Directions API and Google Maps Distance Matrix API.
Generate an API key and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' in the code with your key.
Usage
Set up the project by replacing the API_KEY in the script with your Google Maps API key.

Define the origin, destination, and (optionally) waypoints in the code.

python
Copy code
origin = "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA"
destination = "1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA"
waypoints = ["350 5th Ave, New York, NY", "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC"]
Run the script to retrieve the best route, distance, duration, and directions.

Example output:

vbnet
Copy code
Distance: 43.2 km
Duration: 32 mins
Start Address: 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA
End Address: 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA
Directions:
- Head southeast on Amphitheatre Pkwy
- Turn right onto Charleston Rd
- ...
Parameters
origin: The starting location for the route.
destination: The endpoint for the route.
waypoints (optional): A list of additional stops along the route.
optimize_waypoints: Set to True to optimize the order of waypoints.
Modes of Transport
The mode parameter can be set to:

"driving" (default)
"walking"
"bicycling"
"transit"
Example:

python
Copy code
mode="driving"
API Key Security
Ensure your API key is secured and not hard-coded in public repositories. Use environment variables or secure storage mechanisms where possible.

Troubleshooting
No route found: Ensure the addresses provided are valid and formatted correctly.
API quota exceeded: Make sure your Google Cloud account has sufficient quota for API requests.
Invalid API key: Verify that your API key is correct and that you have enabled the necessary APIs in your Google Cloud Console.
